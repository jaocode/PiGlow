# PiGlow
A Mono DLL for controlling the lights on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a PiGlow board

This is a bit of code I wrote to see if I could drive a Pimoroni PiGlow using C#. The library relies on 
the RPi.I2C.Net library (https://github.com/mshmelev/RPi.I2C.Net). The solution is structured to expect the RPi.I2C.Net
project folder to be present in the solution's folder.
